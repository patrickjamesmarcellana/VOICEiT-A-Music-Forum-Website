I heard it from the mall today so it must be a pop song. It also sounds slightly like EDM. It sounds like it was released around 2012-2015-ish. I've been searching all over Google, Reddit, and YouTube for the past 6 hours and I haven't gotten any close. It is driving me crazy. I will literally give one of my kidneys if any one of you could identify this song. Please help me\n        <br>\n        I've recorded a sample which I hope helps: https://vocaroo.com/12Y0LTxSjHCr\n        ",
